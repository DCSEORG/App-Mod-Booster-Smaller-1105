Create two deployment scripts: deploy-infra.sh and deploy-app.sh in the repository root.
Both scripts must source AgentVariables.sh (also in the repository root) for shared variables (resourceGroup, location, etc.).

--- deploy-infra.sh ---
Deploys all Azure infrastructure. Deployment Order:
1. Deploy resource group
2. Deploy Bicep templates: managed identity, App Service, SQL Database
3. Configure App Service settings (connection strings, managed identity client ID)
4. Wait 30 seconds for SQL Server to be ready
5. Add IP to SQL firewall (current IP + Azure services)

SQL Firewall Configuration:
```bash
MY_IP=$(curl -s https://api.ipify.org)
SQL_SERVER_NAME=$(echo $SQL_SERVER_FQDN | cut -d'.' -f1)

# Allow Azure services (0.0.0.0-0.0.0.0)
az sql server firewall-rule create --name "AllowAllAzureIPs" ...

# Add deployment IP
az sql server firewall-rule create --name "AllowDeploymentIP" --start-ip-address $MY_IP ...
```

--- deploy-app.sh ---
Deploys database objects and application code. Deployment Order (with 30-second waits for resource readiness):
1. Install Python dependencies (pip3 install --quiet pyodbc azure-identity)
2. Import database schema (python3 run-sql.py)
3. Configure database roles (python3 run-sql-dbrole.py)
4. Create stored procedures (python3 run-sql-stored-procs.py)
5. Build and zip application code
6. Deploy app.zip to App Service

App.zip Requirements:
- Exclude from .gitignore (include in repo)
- Files must be at ZIP root (not in subdirectory)
- Must unzip to app folder with DLL inside

Both scripts must be executable with single command: bash deploy-infra.sh or bash deploy-app.sh
Both scripts must source the same AgentVariables.sh file for shared variables.

User notification: App URL is <app-url>/Index (not root)
