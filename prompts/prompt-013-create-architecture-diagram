Create a simple architecture diagram showing:

1. Azure services created by the deployment scripts
2. How services connect to each other
3. Authentication flows (managed identity connections)

Include:
- App Service (with managed identity)
- Azure SQL Database (with Entra ID authentication)
- User-Assigned Managed Identity
- Connection arrows showing:
  * App Service → SQL Database (via managed identity)
  * User → App Service (HTTPS)

Keep diagram simple and clear for understanding the architecture at a glance.
